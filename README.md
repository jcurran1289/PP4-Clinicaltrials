## Introduction
The idea of this project was based around the healthcare industry. This is an industry that I currently work in. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic brining the entire world to stand still, healthcare and more importantly, clinical research are in the spotlight more than ever before. This website allows users to search through clinical trials, view details about the trial and enroll in it. In order to enroll in a trial, a user mist first register on the website. With some many clinical trials out there, this website displays the trials in a nice compact and easy to read format.

## Version Control
Github was used to track the progress of this project. You can see my commit messages at: https://github.com/jcurran1289/PP4-Clinicaltrials/commits/main

## User Experience
The user experience I wanted the user to be able to look and find the information as quickly as possible. The website is easy and straight forward to register and sign up to. I wanted the main content of the website to be accessible to all users while only registered users have the ability to enroll in a study.

## Design
I wanted to keep the style of the website very simple so the focus would be on the clinical trials.

### Colours
The website is all white. I felt this would be the least distracting to the user when reviewing a trial.

### Icons
The Icons used are created with the help of the following sites:
    - [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/start)

## User stories
My goal was to provide the user with a simple a straight forward website to find a clinical trial. A lot of hospitals do not put a lot of effort into their CT (clinical trial) websites. They usually just post a title of a CT and a few paragraphs describing it while a lot of medical terms. This can leave the user unsure what the actual disease that is being treated and if they are eligible or not. This website displays the disease and enrollment criteria very clearly for the user to see.
