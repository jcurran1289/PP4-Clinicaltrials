# CLinical Trials

## Introduction
The idea of this project was based around the healthcare industry. This is a industry that i currently work in. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic brining the entire world to stand still, healthcare and more imprtantly, clinical research are in the spotlight more than ever before. This website allows users to search through clinical trials, view details about the trial and enroll in it. In order to enroll in a trial, a user mist first register on the website. With some many clinical trials out there, this website dispplays the trials in a nice compact and easy to read format.

## User Experience
The user experience I wanted the user to be able to look and find the information as quickly as possible. The website is easy and straight forward to register and sign up to and I wanted the main content of the website to be accessible to all users and only registered users have the ability to enroll in a study.

## Design

## User stories
My goal was to have give the user a simple a straight forward website to find a clinical trial. Alot of hospitals do not put alot of effort into their CT (clinical trial) websites. They usually just post a title of a CT and a few paragraphs about it using alot of medical terms. This can leave the user unsure what the actual disease that is being treated and if they are eligible or not. This website displays the disease and enrollment criteria very clearly for the user to see.

## Testing
All the HTMl and CSS code works as expected and as well as going through the website manually, I have tested the HTML, CSS and Django code using third party validations such as Pep8 for Django and W3C validationf for HTML and CSS.
